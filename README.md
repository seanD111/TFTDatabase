# TFTDatabase
An active, open repository to store all data related to Teamfight Tactics. For the time being, it doesn't seem this 
information is publicly available through Riot or any other source, so this repo serves as a crowd-sourced version of the 
in-game data.

## Formats
At the moment, data is just saved as separate .json files
